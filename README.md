# MyMakefile

This repo contains a collection of Makefile rules for compiling my github projects. You can use for your project.

I do not use CMake because I never understood the need of developping a Makefile generator containing more lines of code than the equivalent hand-write Makefile.

This Makefile can do the following:
* colorful compilation messages.
* can compile static or shared libraries.
* can call gcov, asan, doxgen.
* can compress your project in a tarball.
* have a help.
