### This script is called by (cd .. && make compile-external-libs). It will
### compile third-party libraries cloned previously with make download-external-libs.
###
### To avoid polluting the system, these libraries are not installed on your
### operating system (no sudo make install is called). As a consequence, you have to tell
### your project ../Makefile where to find their files.
###
### The last important point to avoid pollution: it is better to compile third-party
### libraries as static libraries rather than shared libraries to avoid telling your
### system where to find them when you'll start your application.
###
### Input of this script:
### $1: target (your application name)
### $2: script to include defining what to compile.
### $3: architecture (i.e. Linux, Darwin, Windows, Emscripten)
### $4: CC (C compiler)
### $5: CXX (C++ compiler)
